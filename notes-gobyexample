Variables declared without a corresponding initialization are zero-valued.
for is Goâ€™s only looping construct.
In Go, an array is a numbered sequence of elements of a *specific length*.
Slices: dynamic arrays. Unlike arrays, slices are typed only by the elements they contain (not the number of elements).
map: kind of like defaultmap in python
interface: It's like an abstract base class. Any 'struct' which implements all methods of interface can automatically be considered to be derived from this abstract base class.
While both the pointer and non-pointer (pass-by-value) syntax work for creating (stand-alone) methods, when we are implementing interface, we must implement methods using non-pointer method.
